# API Validation CI Templates

This folder contains CI job templates to run the repository's `scripts/run_api_validation.sh` in CI and collect artifacts.

Provided files:

- `.github/workflows/api-validation.yml` — GitHub Actions workflow that: checks out the repo, starts MySQL/Redis/RabbitMQ as services, builds and runs `tea-api`, seeds example SKU, runs `scripts/run_api_validation.sh`, and uploads `build-ci-logs` as artifacts.

- `api-validation.gitlab-ci.yml` — GitLab CI job template with similar steps (services: mysql/redis/rabbitmq). Use it in your project by including or copying into `.gitlab-ci.yml`.

How it works (summary):

1. Start dependent services (mysql/redis/rabbitmq) via CI-provided services.
2. Build and run `tea-api` in background on port `9292`.
3. Run seeder steps (example SKU creation) so validation has minimal data.
4. Run `sh scripts/run_api_validation.sh` which performs HTTP requests and writes responses under `build-ci-logs/api_validation/` and `build-ci-logs/admin_login_response.json`.
5. Upload `build-ci-logs` as CI artifacts for QA review.

Notes & tips:

- If your CI runner doesn't support Docker services, use a self-hosted runner with Docker and run `docker-compose up -d` instead.
- Adjust seeder steps in the workflow to match your required test data.
- Consider adding a short smoke test assertion that checks `build-ci-logs/api_validation/summary.txt` for expected 200 responses to fail the job when regressions occur.
